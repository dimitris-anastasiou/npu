# Neural Processing Unit (NPU)

The Neural Processing Unit (NPU) is designed to leverage a large language model (LLM) to generate behavior trees (BTs) and execute commands on a robot. This project aims to provide a universal framework that can adapt to any robotic infrastructure, interpret natural language commands, and convert them into actionable sequences within a ROS2 environment.

## Features

- **Universal Framework:** Adaptable to any robotic infrastructure with a simple YAML configuration file.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Uses LLMs to interpret and execute commands.
- **Real-time Behavior Tree Generation:** Dynamically generates behavior trees based on natural language input.
- **ROS2 Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with ROS2 for executing robot commands.
