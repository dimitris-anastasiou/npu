# Neural Processing Unit (NPU)
The Neural Processing Unit (NPU) is designed to leverage a large language model (LLM) to generate behavior trees (BTs) and execute commands on a robot. The system will interpret natural language commands and convert them into actionable sequences within a ROS2 environment.
